# Employment Insurance beneficiaries

A responsive line chart implemented with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [D3](https://d3js.org/) that shows
Employment Insurance (EI) beneficiaries in Canada between 2019 and 2021.

Hovering over the chart causes tooltips containing the month and the number of EI beneficiaries to appear.

This project was bootstrapped with the [Svelte app template](https://github.com/sveltejs/template).
